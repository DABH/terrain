      "long_description": "<h4>Gin For The Win</h4> <p>In the days of the seafarer, the open waters played host to many crippling dangers: scurvy,\n   Disney ghost pirates, and the elusive Kraken, but no foe was more treacherous than\n   the shore-dwelling gin swindler.\n</p> <p>Sailors often purchased barrels of gin from these bullion-thirsty bandits, only to later find it had been\n   watered down worse than the Titanic post-iceberg. Unlike the good stuff, diluted gin was not flammable,\n   so if it sloshed onto the gunpowder, the stockpile was compromised.\n</p> <p>Thus, the British Royal Navy instituted a trial by fire: navy officers began pouring prospective\n   gin over black powder. If the powder ignited, they knew the gin was at least 114\n   proof; but if it failed to spark, it was off to the gallows for that filthy, diluting\n   crook.\n</p> <h4>Drink Like A Sailor</h4> <p>The Navy Strength Gin Crate honors the naval tradition of combustible, gunpowder-proof alcohol with a fifth\n   of Leopold's Navy Strength American Gin. The famed Leopold Bros. bolstered this gin's strength\n   and flavor by distilling each botanical separately, and then fusing it all into\n   a 57% abv hurricane of gin and spices.\n</p> <p>For those that believe gin is an old man's drink, this 750 mL of bottled fire is the weathered sea captain\n   in the corner of the bar who backs down from no man and refuses to be overpowered. A dash of lime\n   makes it the perfect anti-scurvy potion.\n</p> <h4>Release the Kraken</h4> <p>We've designed a pair of classic maritime drinking glasses for the heavy-swigging skipper.\n   The laser-etched Kraken attack is a visual symbol of the strength within each glass.\n</p> <p>And the octopus bottle stopper doesn't just prevent party fouls and evaporation,\n   its magical summoning properties can be used to conjure the protective aggression\n   of the Kraken in the event of a surprise pirate attack.\n</p> <p>The Navy Strength Gin Crate harnesses the power and prowess of the high seas into a strong sip of\n   American gin.\n</p>",

For the Greeks, it was the medieval Renaissance and \"healthy\"\n   yogurt; the dinosaurs had Jeff Goldblum and Co.; and the fallen scotch whisky distilleries\n   have The Lost Distillery.\n</p> <p>Despite sounding like an episode of the Hardy Boys, Lost Distillery is the preeminent name in historical\n   whisky reclamation. They chase their whisky with history to create \"present day expressions of legendary\n   whiskies\" nearly a century old; basically, they're sending your tastebuds back in time.\n</p> <h4>The Ghost Of Whisky Past</h4> <p>The Lost Distillery Company has made us privy to three 92 proof single malt whiskies from their Classic\n   Selection: Auchnagie (1812-1911), Gerston (1796-1882; 1886-1914), and Stratheden (1829-1926). We'll send\n   whichever whisky is best matured at the moment to showcase its legendary reputation.\n</p> <p>Auchnagie honors the original Perthshire distillery's local highland peats and high-mineral\n   stream with a mixture of honeysuckle, soft citrus, and peppery spices. Gerston combines\n   ripefruit, toffee, smokes, and spices to recreate the briny peat flavor and short\n   \"smuggler's\" still of the original Caithness distillery. And Stratheden utilizes\n   Sherry casks and sparkling water to commemorate the salty, earthy water of the Lover's\n   Pool in Stratheden.\n</p> <h4>Refined Whisky Companions</h4> <p>Scotland is so whisky-obsessed, they designed crystal glasses with a wide bowl and tapered mouth to best\n   mature every bit of the whisky's aroma and flavor. Drink whisky from anything but a Glencairn\n   glass in Scotland, and they will kick you clean out of the country.\n</p> <p>We're also including a Vinturi whisky aerator for proper aeration and a set of slate coasters\n   for classy presentation.\n</p> <p>The Scotch Whisky Crate reclaims the boldest and best of whisky past for the tasting pleasures of the\n   present.\n</p>",

So not all mezcals are tequila, but all tequilas are mezcals,\n   kind of like how not all demons are cats, but all cats are blood-thirsty hell-creatures.\n</p> <p>Tequila may have sold its soul to the monsters of mass production for a salted\n   shot in the limelight, but traditional mezcal continues its emphasis on small batch,\n   craft artisanal flavor.\n</p> <h4>The Black Mark of Mexico</h4> <p>Mezcal doesn't get more authentic than Marka Negra's Espadin variety, a double-distilled 750 mL\n   bottle that measures 102 proof and 100% Mexican mysticism. Instead of pandering\n   to the masses, Marka Negra mezcaleros (master distillers) craft the mezcal taste\n   to their local communities, in this case San Luis del Rio, Oaxaca, Mexico.\n</p> <p>Abel, the mezcalero of this particular espadin line, even served this mezcal at his wedding,\n   so every sip will be filled with authentic Oaxacan flavor and the warm spirit of\n   a massive party you weren't invited to.\n</p> <h4>Flavor The Firewater</h4> <p>For the straight shooters, we've included a pair of Himalayan shot glasses to help infuse\n   the mezcal with a strong, salty bite. These 3 inch rose-quartz salt glasses inject\n   natural flavor, need not be washed between use, and look much better on the bar\n   than piles of spilled salt.\n</p> <p>Or continue spinning round the mezcal carousel with the finest cocktail order south of the border: the\n   Oaxacan Old Fashioned (pronounced wah-hah-ken, you uncultured buffoon!). Mix in Bittermilk No. 6's cocoa\n   husk-aged cocktail mix of spices and chiles for a strong, bittersweet mezcal treat.\n</p> <p>Skip the cheap tequila and explore the traditional, artisanal flavors of Mexican spirits with the Mezcal\n   Crate.\n</p>",
