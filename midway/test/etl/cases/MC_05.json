Etching your initials into a glass decanter is a public declaration of your affinity for whiskey.\r\n   It's like donning a trenchcoat and holding a boombox overhead blasting Peter Gabriel's\r\n   \"In Your Eyes\" outside of whiskey's house or barging past the TSA checkpoint to frantically\r\n   sprint through the airport terminal for a last second  whiskey\r\n   before boarding your plane.\r\n While the monogrammed decanter looks super classy when flanked by its matching pair of personalized\r\n   rocks tumblers, whiskey should be appraised by taste as well as  presentation. The decanter properly\r\n   aerates and settles your whiskey so you can settle down with a glass of good company anytime.\r\n Good Company Rounding out the Whiskey Appreciation Crate is the ultimate whiskey connoisseur collection: A pair of\r\n   Tovolo Ice Molds and slate coasters, a pocket-sized whiskey tasting journal, and the most important whiskey\r\n   accessory, premium savory snacks.\r\n Box up those dusty sports trophies and find a stud to hang your awkward family portraits, because the\r\n   Personalized Whiskey Decanter is reclaiming whiskey's proper place atop your mantel.\r\n",

As much as we enjoy the idea of distilling our own gin, we moreso enjoy keeping our eyesight,\r\n   bathtubs, and status as mostly law-abiding citizens intact. And while DIY spirit\r\n   distillation isn't as mischievous as Prohibition-era propaganda paints it, it'll\r\n   still earn a modern-day moonshiner a few free nights in the county lock-up.\r\n Thankfully, we've found a way to get in on gin without also getting a visit from\r\n   Johnny Law or his lesser known siblings Jimmy Firefighter and Jenny Emergency Ocular\r\n   Surgeon.\r\n Compound gin is our legal loophole. It infuses the spirit after\r\n   distillation and is an easy entry into the world of producing excellent, custom\r\n   cocktail spirits. The Gin-Fusion Kit is the perfect DIY process for the true gintleman.\r\n The Heart of Gin Juniper berries make up the base foundation for any gin, so we've included a healthy amount in the\r\n   Gin-Fusion Kit.\r\n We've also assembled a botanical dream team, nine flavor muses to infuse the gin with a unique\r\n   personality. These botanicals are the active ingredients responsible for every gin's\r\n   unique aroma and flavor.\r\n The Man Crates-exclusive gin-making instruction book comes with three recipes for a surefire success. It\r\n   also strongly encourages experimentation.\r\n Bottles on Bottles Good news! Making compound gin doesn't require slowly stealing lab equipment from a community college\r\n   chemistry class the way distilling gin does. These fancy glass bottles should do the trick.\r\n We're including two 375mL bottles for flavor infusion, which we hear can split\r\n   a 750mL bottle of vodka evenly. We can't know for sure since we were forcibly removed\r\n   from that community college chemistry class before fractions were covered.\r\n The Gin-Fusion Kit puts the fun and freedom of gin infusion into the hands of the everyman.",

And while DIY spirit\r\n   distillation isn't as mischievous as Prohibition-era propaganda paints it, it'll\r\n   still earn a modern-day moonshiner a few free nights in the county lock-up.\r\n</p> <p>Thankfully, we've found a way to get in on gin without also getting a visit from\r\n   Johnny Law or his lesser known siblings Jimmy Firefighter and Jenny Emergency Ocular\r\n   Surgeon.\r\n</p> <p>Compound gin is our legal loophole. It infuses the spirit after\r\n   distillation and is an easy entry into the world of producing excellent, custom\r\n   cocktail spirits. The Gin-Fusion Kit is the perfect DIY process for the true gintleman.\r\n</p> <h4>The Heart of Gin</h4> <p>Juniper berries make up the base foundation for any gin, so we've included a healthy amount in the\r\n   Gin-Fusion Kit.\r\n</p> <p>We've also assembled a botanical dream team, nine flavor muses to infuse the gin with a unique\r\n   personality. These botanicals are the active ingredients responsible for every gin's\r\n   unique aroma and flavor.\r\n</p> <p>The Man Crates-exclusive gin-making instruction book comes with three recipes for a surefire success. It\r\n   also strongly encourages experimentation.\r\n</p> <h4>Bottles on Bottles</h4> <p>Good news! Making compound gin doesn't require slowly stealing lab equipment from a community college\r\n   chemistry class the way distilling gin does. These fancy glass bottles should do the trick.\r\n</p> <p>We're including two 375mL bottles for flavor infusion, which we hear can split\r\n   a 750mL bottle of vodka evenly. We can't know for sure since we were forcibly removed\r\n   from that community college chemistry class before fractions were covered.\r\n</p> <p>The Gin-Fusion Kit puts the fun and freedom of gin infusion into the hands of the everyman.</p>",

The Revolutionary War MVP and celebrity endorser of\r\n   the one dollar bill knew that no amount of prestige or accomplishments could rival\r\n   the warm satisfaction of a good glass of whiskey.\r\n</p> <p>In days past, a man's fondness for whiskey was admirably brandished in full home bars, but in modern times,\r\n   whiskey is hidden out of sight in cabinets and desk drawers like shameful secrets. The Whiskey Appreciation\r\n   Crate is here to restore honor to the once great bond between a man and his drink.\r\n</p> <h4>Oh, yes we de-can!</h4> <p>Etching your initials into a glass decanter is a public declaration of your affinity for whiskey.\r\n   It's like donning a trenchcoat and holding a boombox overhead blasting Peter Gabriel's\r\n   \"In Your Eyes\" outside of whiskey's house or barging past the TSA checkpoint to frantically\r\n   sprint through the airport terminal for a last second  whiskey\r\n   before boarding your plane.\r\n</p> <p>While the monogrammed decanter looks super classy when flanked by its matching pair of personalized\r\n   rocks tumblers, whiskey should be appraised by taste as well as  presentation. The decanter properly\r\n   aerates and settles your whiskey so you can settle down with a glass of good company anytime.\r\n</p> <h4>Good Company</h4> <p>Rounding out the Whiskey Appreciation Crate is the ultimate whiskey connoisseur collection: A pair of\r\n   Tovolo Ice Molds and slate coasters, a pocket-sized whiskey tasting journal, and the most important whiskey\r\n   accessory, premium savory snacks.\r\n</p> <p>Box up those dusty sports trophies and find a stud to hang your awkward family portraits, because the\r\n   Personalized Whiskey Decanter is reclaiming whiskey's proper place atop your mantel.\r\n</p>",

Demitri, the Marco Polo of Bloody Marys, has been boldly exploring the exotic world\r\n   of spices, and we're sending three of his perfectly mixed flavors: Classic, Horseradish,\r\n   and Chilies and Peppers.\r\n</p> <h4>Leaning Tower of Toppings</h4> <p>Balancing skewered, top-heavy garnishes like fried chicken or a full stack of pancakes is an art, and\r\n   your first few endeavors will no doubt be accompanied by slips and spills. Hone your stacking skills with\r\n   this pair of infinium plastic Pilsner glasses that won't break when they topple over or are shot with a\r\n   firearm at close range (not legally-binding).\r\n</p> <p>Build a beast of a brunch beverage with the Bloody Mary Man Crate.</p>",

Smirnoff owner John Martin had to store his unsellable\n   alcohol in the Cock N' Bull, a bar owned by Martin's equally bland-named friend Jack Morgan.\n   In an effort to clear out the basement, the bartender began mixing Smirnoff with\n   Morgan's unpopular ginger beer in mugs from his girlfriend's failed copper factory.\n</p> <p>It was a risky move to toss a bunch of undesirable things together and re-sell\n   it (scientists call this The Hot Dog Phenomena), but the strategy was an overwhelming\n   success. Soon, every trendsetter in Tinseltown was posing for the Polaroid paparazzi\n   with a copper mug in hand.\n</p> <p>Sadly, nothing copper can stay, and when the Cold War hit in the 1950's, true blue Americans began\n   boycotting vodka, aka \"Communist Tap Water\". The Moscow Mule faded into obscurity.\n</p> <h4>Three Cheers for Diplomacy!</h4> <p>But today, over half a century later, the United States and Russia share a giant\n   orbiting timeshare in outer space, and the only thing remotely Communist about vodka\n   is how freely Smirnoff Ice bottles get shared on college campuses. The world is\n   ready for the return of the Moscow Mule.\n</p> <p>In addition to the original Cock N' Bull ginger beer, the Moscow Mule Crate includes a pair of authentic\n   copper drinking mugs, Tovolo ice cube mold, 16 oz. mixed drink shaker, and measuring jigger, so\n   you can enjoy one of America's finest, definitely-not-Russian mixed drinks.\n</p> <p>Mix it up the classy way, and taste the kick of the Moscow Mule.</p>",

A guy who loses his keys as often as he does can’t be trusted with bomb-detonating cufflinks. And who wants to ruin their nicest and only suit crawling through those dusty casino air ducts?</p>\r\n  <p>The Storied Spy Cocktail Crate lets him kick his up feet, crack open a book, and cut straight to the action. With a martini in hand, of course. Shaken, not stirred. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Doohickey Dossier</h4>\r\n  <ul>\r\n\t<li>The cocktail shaker set comes complete with a double jigger and two liquor pourers, perfect for sneaking an odorless poison into the glass of a double-crossing, foreign diplomat.</li>\r\n\t<li>These vermouth-brined olives have been raised since birth by the Jack Rudy Cocktail Company to provide the finishing touch on a dirty martini.</li>\r\n    <li> Ian Fleming’s <i>Casino Royale</i> is frequently touted as the first truly great spy novel. By us.</li>\r\n\t<li>The credit card-sized multi-tool is perfect for disarming bombs, disassembling Ikea furniture, or measuring items up to 3” in length. Just like one Q would make.</li>\r\n  </ul>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>Gin For the Win!</h4> <p>As much as we enjoy the idea of distilling our own gin, we moreso enjoy keeping our eyesight,\r\n   bathtubs, and status as mostly law-abiding citizens intact. And while DIY spirit\r\n   distillation isn't as mischievous as Prohibition-era propaganda paints it, it'll\r\n   still earn a modern-day moonshiner a few free nights in the county lock-up.\r\n</p> <p>Thankfully, we've found a way to get in on gin without also getting a visit from\r\n   Johnny Law or his lesser known siblings Jimmy Firefighter and Jenny Emergency Ocular\r\n   Surgeon.\r\n</p> <p>Compound gin is our legal loophole. It infuses the spirit after\r\n   distillation and is an easy entry into the world of producing excellent, custom\r\n   cocktail spirits. The Gin-Fusion Kit is the perfect DIY process for the true gintleman.\r\n</p> <h4>The Heart of Gin</h4> <p>Juniper berries make up the base foundation for any gin, so we've included a healthy amount in the\r\n   Gin-Fusion Kit.\r\n</p> <p>We've also assembled a botanical dream team, nine flavor muses to infuse the gin with a unique\r\n   personality. These botanicals are the active ingredients responsible for every gin's\r\n   unique aroma and flavor.\r\n</p> <p>The Man Crates-exclusive gin-making instruction book comes with three recipes for a surefire success. It\r\n   also strongly encourages experimentation.\r\n</p> <h4>Bottles on Bottles</h4> <p>Good news! Making compound gin doesn't require slowly stealing lab equipment from a community college\r\n   chemistry class the way distilling gin does. These fancy glass bottles should do the trick.\r\n</p> <p>We're including two 375mL bottles for flavor infusion, which we hear can split\r\n   a 750mL bottle of vodka evenly. We can't know for sure since we were forcibly removed\r\n   from that community college chemistry class before fractions were covered.\r\n</p> <p>The Gin-Fusion Kit puts the fun and freedom of gin infusion into the hands of the everyman.</p>",
