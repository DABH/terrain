The Sausage Making Kit brings the age-old tradition of tubing up tasty beef, wild game, poultry, pork, and lamb right to his kitchen.</p>\r\n  <p>Once he starts cranking out fresh, handmade sausages, he'll have to cram \"Sausage King of the Neighborhood\" into his official title.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>A Link of His Own</h4>\r\n  <ul>\r\n\t<li>He'll be churning out chorizo like a champ with the Norpro Meat Grinder, which features a powerful suction cup for convenient countertop use.

The Sumerians wrote\r\n   hymns to the exhilarating nature of beer, the Chinese experimented extensively with\r\n   rice fermentations, and there's even cursory evidence of beer predating human history.\r\n   (Those monkeys were crafty!)\r\n</p> <p>In past days, the brewers were the esteemed men of the world, the gatekeepers to the ethereal knowledge of\r\n   medicine, pleasure, and the divine. Nowadays, we've degraded the ancient craft to big industry corporations\r\n   and a shoddy baseball team in Milwaukee.\r\n</p> <p>The best way to restore rightful honor to the lost art of beer brewing, to bottle your impeccable taste on\r\n   the most intricate level, is to do it yourself.\r\n</p> <h4>Get Weird With Your Beer</h4> <p>Start stocking your well-curated home bar with well-aerated home beer brewed in your very\r\n   kitchen. The Micro Brewed project kit features the floral and citrusy aroma, balanced\r\n   flavors, and American pedigree of Centennial Hops and a SMASH (Single Malt and Single\r\n   Hop) Recipe that pulls everything out of the way to let the Centennial hops speak\r\n   unimpeded.\r\n</p> <p>And these hops have a lot to say.</p> <p>The 1.5 gallon Little Bubbler gives more head room than a topless Jeep Wrangler for the most robust of\r\n   beers, yet is small enough to fit comfortably in a Brooklyn wash closet of a studio\r\n   apartment. The one gallon batch size invites more freedom and creativity into your\r\n   recipes, so you can embrace your artistic genius unimpeded, with less pride to swallow\r\n   if your secret ingredient is less hit and more miss.\r\n</p> <h4>Fermentation Activation!</h4> <p>Racking, measuring, sanitizing, and bottling: all things you will soon be intimately\r\n   familiar with. Intimately. We've curated the ultimate collection of tubes and jib-jabs\r\n   to transform simple ingredients into a beer that will make friends and colleagues\r\n   enjoy, respect, and deeply envy your brewing expertise.\r\n</p> <p>Carry on the legacy of first-rate fermentation and inject some hoppiness into your happiness with the\r\n   Home Brewed project kit.\r\n</p>",

It infuses the spirit after\r\n   distillation and is an easy entry into the world of producing excellent, custom\r\n   cocktail spirits. The Gin-Fusion Kit is the perfect DIY process for the true gintleman.\r\n</p> <h4>The Heart of Gin</h4> <p>Juniper berries make up the base foundation for any gin, so we've included a healthy amount in the\r\n   Gin-Fusion Kit.\r\n</p> <p>We've also assembled a botanical dream team, nine flavor muses to infuse the gin with a unique\r\n   personality. These botanicals are the active ingredients responsible for every gin's\r\n   unique aroma and flavor.\r\n</p> <p>The Man Crates-exclusive gin-making instruction book comes with three recipes for a surefire success. It\r\n   also strongly encourages experimentation.\r\n</p> <h4>Bottles on Bottles</h4> <p>Good news! Making compound gin doesn't require slowly stealing lab equipment from a community college\r\n   chemistry class the way distilling gin does. These fancy glass bottles should do the trick.\r\n</p> <p>We're including two 375mL bottles for flavor infusion, which we hear can split\r\n   a 750mL bottle of vodka evenly. We can't know for sure since we were forcibly removed\r\n   from that community college chemistry class before fractions were covered.\r\n</p> <p>The Gin-Fusion Kit puts the fun and freedom of gin infusion into the hands of the everyman.</p>",

The\n   finished product will be as intricately layered as a fennel avocado bean dip, and\n   every bit as distinctive as the chef who made it.\n</p> <h4>All Ingredients Included</h4> <p>The kit comes stuffed with various rasps and files, a portable bench vise, and\n   enough sandpaper to take the green off a watermelon. It's also a great excuse to\n   dust off the ol' power tools hanging in the garage. And with our step-by-step instruction\n   booklet, crafting this knife will be as effortless as cooking with it.\n</p> <p>The Chef Knife Making Kit is just what the modern day Michelangelo of meat needs to\n   carve up the next five-star entree.\n</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>Etch His Sketch</h4>\r\n\r\n  <p>Working as a sailor has always been the most affordable way to see the world. But between ports, there's an awful lot of ocean to look at. And nary a jacuzzi, casino, or mini-golf course on deck. With plenty of free time on their hands, sailors got hands-on, making a mark with personalized knife handles.</p>\r\n  <p>The art of carving designs into bone knife handles is known as scrimshawing. It takes a steady hand and strong discipline, much like the seamanship required to steer a vessel through a white squall with 20-foot swells.</p>\r\n  <p>The Scrimshaw Knife Kit supplies the knife, tools, and instructions to make sure his maiden voyage is smooth sailing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Scrim a Little Off the Sides</h4>\r\n  <ul>\r\n\t<li>The Boker Traditional Series Gentleman's Lockback Knife has a high-quality stainless steel blade and a white bone handle that's begging for an etching.</li>\r\n\t<li>A soup-to-nuts batch of scrimshawing supplies will set him up for success. There's a metal scribe, Higgins Black Ink, Renaissance Wax—even a slab of Micarta practicin' ivory.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Lansky Dual Grit Sharpener gets right to the point, whether he's sharpening his blade, fishing hooks, or his wit. Maybe not that last one.</li>\r\n\r\n  </ul>",
