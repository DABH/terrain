We've acquired that monstrous laser from \"Goldfinger\" and repurposed its settings from burning James Bond's\r\n   giblets to etching names into pint glasses with perfect precision.\r\n So while Barry's crying alone in his mansion over a frozen microwave dinner, you can be toasting real\r\n   success with three close buddies and four awesome personalized pint glasses.\r\n The Man, The Myth, The Legendary Coasters The matching set of personalized wooden coasters are classy and clean--like drying your tabletops with bear\r\n   skin napkins. Plus, they double as bottle-openers, which means less time scavenging in drawers and more\r\n   time swapping epic drinking stories. Like when you once wrestled a croc while wearing Crocs purely out of\r\n   hubris.\r\n And we've got snacks with your name on them. Figuratively. We used to personalize every individual nut and\r\n   pretzel, but they got inhaled too quickly for anyone to notice.\r\n Grab the Personalized Barware Crate today and ensure the world never forgets your name.",

The Whiskey Appreciation\r\n   Crate is here to restore honor to the once great bond between a man and his drink.\r\n</p> <h4>Oh, yes we de-can!</h4> <p>Etching your initials into a glass decanter is a public declaration of your affinity for whiskey.\r\n   It's like donning a trenchcoat and holding a boombox overhead blasting Peter Gabriel's\r\n   \"In Your Eyes\" outside of whiskey's house or barging past the TSA checkpoint to frantically\r\n   sprint through the airport terminal for a last second  whiskey\r\n   before boarding your plane.\r\n</p> <p>While the monogrammed decanter looks super classy when flanked by its matching pair of personalized\r\n   rocks tumblers, whiskey should be appraised by taste as well as  presentation. The decanter properly\r\n   aerates and settles your whiskey so you can settle down with a glass of good company anytime.\r\n</p> <h4>Good Company</h4> <p>Rounding out the Whiskey Appreciation Crate is the ultimate whiskey connoisseur collection: A pair of\r\n   Tovolo Ice Molds and slate coasters, a pocket-sized whiskey tasting journal, and the most important whiskey\r\n   accessory, premium savory snacks.\r\n</p> <p>Box up those dusty sports trophies and find a stud to hang your awkward family portraits, because the\r\n   Personalized Whiskey Decanter is reclaiming whiskey's proper place atop your mantel.\r\n</p>",

It's a celebration,\r\n   not a summer reading list.\r\n</p> <p>We've concocted a brilliant ruse that plays on humanity's widespread discomfort with the extremely longform\r\n   written word. The Secret Stash Personalized Flask takes him from dustjacket disappointment to actual lived\r\n   adventures with the simple turn of a page.\r\n</p> <h4>An Intoxicating Story</h4> <p>We've been told to judge a book not by its cover, but by the contents of its pages. Well,\r\n   these pages conceal a personalized drinking vessel, so it's basically an instant literary classic. Housed\r\n   within the pages itself is a sleek 6 oz. stainless steel flask.\r\n</p> <p>And we've penned our own literary masterpiece by lasering onto the matte black finish. The only thing about\r\n   this gift he'll have to read is his name.\r\n</p> <p>Best of all, the book can be re-used as a \"security-by-obscurity\" safety-deposit book.</p> <h4>Too Good To Be True</h4> <p>To up the outrage factor before the big reveal, we've created some phoney dust jackets that will raise far\r\n   more questions than answers. Choose which of these three terrible books he'll have to awkwardly pretend to\r\n   enjoy receiving:\r\n</p> <ul>\r\n  <li> Vampire Desires, a gripping romance-fantasy adventure of immortal love, loss, and lust;</li>\r\n  <li> Have You Seen My Keys, the latest installment of the unacclaimed and unrequested Sherluck Holmes\r\n       mystery series\r\n  </li>\r\n  <li> How to Hide Your Stuff, a simpleton's conspiracy theory/self-help book from the paranoid mind of one\r\n       Jedd Dangus\r\n  </li>\r\n</ul> <p>And if he has concerns about displaying any of these on his bookshelf, we've printed Plan B directly onto\r\n   the spine of the book. He can remove the dust jacket and hide in plain sight the inconspicuous book, Biting\r\n   Your Neighbor's Horse: and other confusing euphemisms.\r\n</p> <p>The Secret Stash Personalized Flask is an unforgettable gift of surprise and safekeeping.</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>The Hole Nine Yards<h4> <p>In a recent poll, golf balls ranked third among things men enjoy hitting most, lagging just behind “the gym” and “unrealistic sales goals.” But while those things may be tough to leave a mark on, leaving his mark on the course has never been easier.</p>\r\n  \r\n<p>Each ball is precisely monogrammed with our state-of-the-art UV printers and guaranteed to last at least as long as it takes him to lose them in a pond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Personalized Golf Balls Mini Crate contains 30 units of self-expression, each ready to be teed up like an easy golf pun and knocked out of the park like a mixed sports metaphor. Next time he hits the links, make sure he does it with more style than a pair of plaid pants.</p>",
