We don't know\r\n   why they're so hell-bent on consuming human flesh or how they're melting\r\n   the ice caps to sink our planet into their watery ambush. All we know is they're up to no good.\r\n While we would never stoop to their lowly level by feasting on them, we want them to know we could. With\r\n   every catch and release, we whisper in their scaly little fish ears, \"Go tell your friends there's a new\r\n   sheriff in town.\"\r\n We are the Bass Whisperers, humanity's last line of defense against mass bass digestion. Hook, Line, and Sucker Power and precision are useless against these\r\n   murderous sea-beasts. You can only catch a bass with a swift angling of poetic justice.\r\n   This lure set capitalizes on the insatiable gluttony and cowardice of these\r\n  greedy sons o' fishes by feigning helplessness, then executing a strong left\r\n   jab with a sharp right hook.\r\n The Pivot Frog tangoes sans-tangle in the top-water weeds, the Warpig emits a\r\n   seductive Siren-song in the mid-range waters, and the Pitbull will skim scour the\r\n   surface with the reckless fury of Liam Neeson if a largemouth bass had just kidnapped\r\n   his daughter.\r\n Nightcrawlers are usually easy-pickings due to their docile nature and lack of limbs, but give your worms\r\n  the Schwarzenegger Treatment with a good, ol' fashion worm blower, and those\r\n   pumped up water pythons will be armed with irresistible allure and unyielding strength.\r\n Sentry of the Sea The bass whisperer is a lonely, thankless role, but a band of bottles always make for\r\n   good spirits. The neoprene-insulated cooler ensures your drinks stay as cold as the blood coursing through\r\n   your veins.\r\n Eternal vigilance is the cost of liberty. Equip your vessel to record the growth of these\r\n  water-breathing death bringers: a portable dial scale for science reasons and\r\n   a good pair of needlenose pliers, because they don't need to keep the hook to get the point.\r\n Keep your loved ones safe and those savage bass at bay with the Bass Whisperer Crate.",

      "LongDescription": "Eat Well in the Wild \nThere are plenty of things in the Great Outdoors that could kill\n   a man; his own campfire cooking need not be one of those things.\n No camper, no matter how cooking-incompetent, should have to subsist on trail mix and fruit\n   scraps alone like some common tree squirrel. We developed the Dutch Oven Project\n   Kit to transform the average/below-average camping cook into a culinary master.\n Much Lovin' Dutch Oven The cast-iron Dutch Oven belongs to a storied tradition of five-star frontier flavor. Fun fact: Lewis and\n   Clark cooked with multiple Dutch Ovens during their western expedition. Less fun fact: they were probably\n   cooking Raccoon Ragout and Possum Porridge.\n The Dutch Oven we've selected is a pre-seasoned 12\" cast-iron pot that can stew, braise, roast, bake, boil,\n   fry, or poach 6-7 quarts of gourmet buffet. We've also included Campmaid's kickstand/lid-lifter ideal for\n   raising the roof when the pot gets hot, or propping up the oven to bait and trap curious forest critters.\n Rust-Free Recipes Like a veteran quarterback, a cast-iron pot requires tender care and attention to maintain any semblance of\n   a season. This kit includes a chain mail scrubber and cast iron conditioner to keep the oven tasty and\n   rust-free.\n The DIY Dutch Oven Guide includes Dutch Oven care methods, cooking techniques, and most importantly, five\n   amazing and simple Man Crates recipes for ultimate outdoor flavor. We'd risk scoliosis backpacking\n   a Dutch Oven to every campsite and cookout if it meant getting to enjoy meals like\n   the Tri-Animal Jambalaya or Classic Cobbler.\n For the guy who tends to make his feasts in the forest, the Dutch Oven is everything but the kitchen sink\n   to make the outdoors a tastier place.\n",

We don't know\r\n   why they're so <span class=\"highlight\">hell-bent on consuming human flesh</span> or how they're melting\r\n   the ice caps to sink our planet into their watery ambush. All we know is they're up to no good.\r\n</p> <p>While we would never stoop to their lowly level by feasting on them, we want them to know we could. With\r\n   every catch and release, we whisper in their scaly little fish ears, \"Go tell your friends there's a new\r\n   sheriff in town.\"\r\n</p> <p>We are the Bass Whisperers, humanity's last line of defense against mass bass digestion.</p> <h4>Hook, Line, and Sucker</h4> <p>Power and precision are useless against these\r\n   murderous sea-beasts. You can only catch a bass with a swift angling of poetic justice.\r\n   This lure set capitalizes on the insatiable gluttony and cowardice of these\r\n  <span class=\"highlight\">greedy sons o' fishes</span> by feigning helplessness, then executing a strong left\r\n   jab with a sharp right hook.\r\n</p> <p>The Pivot Frog tangoes sans-tangle in the top-water weeds, the Warpig emits a\r\n   seductive Siren-song in the mid-range waters, and the Pitbull will skim scour the\r\n   surface with the reckless fury of Liam Neeson if a largemouth bass had just kidnapped\r\n   his daughter.\r\n</p> <p>Nightcrawlers are usually easy-pickings due to their docile nature and lack of limbs, but give your worms\r\n  <span class=\"highlight\">the Schwarzenegger Treatment</span> with a good, ol' fashion worm blower, and those\r\n   pumped up water pythons will be armed with irresistible allure and unyielding strength.\r\n</p> <h4>Sentry of the Sea</h4> <p>The bass whisperer is a lonely, thankless role, but a band of bottles always make for\r\n   good spirits. The neoprene-insulated cooler ensures your drinks stay as cold as the blood coursing through\r\n   your veins.\r\n</p> <p>Eternal vigilance is the cost of liberty. Equip your vessel to record the growth of these\r\n  <span class=\"highlight\">water-breathing death bringers</span>: a portable dial scale for science reasons and\r\n   a good pair of needlenose pliers, because they don't need to keep the hook to get the point.\r\n</p> <p>Keep your loved ones safe and those savage bass at bay with the Bass Whisperer Crate.</p>",

We think the world of their graceful agility, grandiose color\r\n   patterns, and overall trustworthy character.\r\n</p> <p>They are beautiful, emotionally-complex creatures, and if there was a way we could enjoy their delicious\r\n   meaty insides without angling and gutting them, we would.

This portable stainless steel\r\n   wire cage attaches to any stick for a quick, crispy dinner, and honors the slain\r\n   with a traditional viking burial.\r\n</p> <h4>Delicious Fish Dishes</h4> <p>The most worthy tribute to a caught and cooked trout is to ensure its death was deliciously\r\n   not in vain. For the trout traditionalists, the zesty citrus O'Fish'ial Blend Trout\r\n   Seasoning ensures every trout reaches its finest flavor potential in life and beyond.\r\n</p> <p>We've unlocked the mysteries of supreme trout flavor in our tell-all book of ingenious meal\r\n   creations--TROUT: Avant-Garde Recipes for the Trout Enthusiast.

Miles from civilization, not even your cornflower-blue-shirt-wearing\r\n   boss Tad can encroach on your weekend. <span class='highlight'>You're off the grid.</span></p>\r\n<p>The untamed wilderness is your proving ground.

You\r\n   wield it with the strength and precision of a grizzled mountaineer. At this rate, it's only a matter of\r\n   time before you trade in your sleeping bag for a log cabin, but you need to set up camp before something\r\n   mistakes you for dinner.\r\n</p> <p>You're a descendant of Man, and Man discovered fire. Yours is crackling merrily in no time with a few\r\n   strikes of your <span class=\"highlight\">firestarter</span>. The camp is your domain - would-be predators\r\n   keep their distance, and the chill leaves your bones.\r\n</p> <h4>Survival of the Fittest</h4> <p>In the morning, you boil water and whip up some hard-earned hot grub while consulting your dog-eared copy\r\n   of the Army Field Manual. With luck, the only hairy situation you'll have is the\r\n  <span class=\"highlight\">prodigious beard</span> that will inevitably sprout during your walkabout, but it\r\n   helps to have the backup. Channeling John Wayne with a little cowboy coffee, you toast your first night of\r\n   survival. <span class=\"highlight\">Nature,  0. You, 1</span>.\r\n</p> <p>You feel invigorated. You make short work of striking camp, and take your bearings. If you end up in a\r\n   staring contest with a mountain lion, you'll be ready. It's going to be a good weekend.\r\n</p>",

We developed the Dutch Oven Project\n   Kit to transform the average/below-average camping cook into a culinary master.\n</p> <h5>Much Lovin' Dutch Oven</h5> <p>The cast-iron Dutch Oven belongs to a storied tradition of five-star frontier flavor. Fun fact: Lewis and\n   Clark cooked with multiple Dutch Ovens during their western expedition. Less fun fact: they were probably\n   cooking Raccoon Ragout and Possum Porridge.\n</p> <p>The Dutch Oven we've selected is a pre-seasoned 12\" cast-iron pot that can stew, braise, roast, bake, boil,\n   fry, or poach 6-7 quarts of gourmet buffet. We've also included Campmaid's kickstand/lid-lifter ideal for\n   raising the roof when the pot gets hot, or propping up the oven to bait and trap curious forest critters.\n</p> <h4>Rust-Free Recipes</h4> <p>Like a veteran quarterback, a cast-iron pot requires tender care and attention to maintain any semblance of\n   a season. This kit includes a chain mail scrubber and cast iron conditioner to keep the oven tasty and\n   rust-free.\n</p> <p>The DIY Dutch Oven Guide includes Dutch Oven care methods, cooking techniques, and most importantly, five\n   amazing and simple Man Crates recipes for ultimate outdoor flavor. We'd risk scoliosis backpacking\n   a Dutch Oven to every campsite and cookout if it meant getting to enjoy meals like\n   the Tri-Animal Jambalaya or Classic Cobbler.\n</p> <p>For the guy who tends to make his feasts in the forest, the Dutch Oven is everything but the kitchen sink\n   to make the outdoors a tastier place.\n</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>Something To Write Home About</h4> <p>Dearest Agnes,</p> <p>All the words in all the world could not begin to fully express my gratitude for the Military Care Crate\r\n   you sent. Daily necessities are hard to come by out here, but your tender affections have never once felt\r\n   scarce.\r\n</p> <p>The men in my dug-out jest that the bona fide love of any relationship is best known by the courier, and\r\n   I'll be damned if their jaws didn't hit the trench when your gift arrived in the post. The spring-assisted,\r\n   stonewashed blade is absolutely splendid, and while I pray with earnest its handiness is only required upon\r\n   a can of beans, I now feel prepared for whatever may come.\r\n</p> <h4>A Cup Of G.I. Joe</h4> <p>My darling, the coffee here is practically dirt, and I should know as I'm often\r\n   tasked with shoveling and sifting soil into the grounds when rations run low. \"A\r\n   little mud don't hurt the body,\" but it sure takes a toll on the soul.\r\n</p> <p>I could swear on our pup's good eye that the clouds parted and black manna fell from\r\n   the heavens the moment those Lock N' Load coffee grounds and java drip arrived.\r\n   I'd fear it might go missing if not for its compact folding feature and the sluggish,\r\n   decaffeinated nature of the others.\r\n</p> <h4>Through Tempest And Tears</h4> <p>The thought of you as I write has not left me shy of tears, though you wouldn't know\r\n   it as I pen this upon the Rite in the Rain notebook. The waterproof nature has proven\r\n   itself extremely useful as my pockets often get extremely sweaty, almost embarrassingly\r\n   so, while shoveling dirt into coffee bags.\r\n</p> <p>I fear this is not the fondest of images to leave you with, but this correspondence has already run long,\r\n   and as my betrothed, you were bound to find out about my sweating tendencies eventually.\r\n</p> <p>My deepest love and gratitude for the Military Care Crate.</p> <p>We proudly offer a standing 10% discount for military families. Please call us at <b>1-866-902-7260</b> for assistance.\r\n</p>",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>Life of a Dripster</h4> <p>Some people wake up with coffee, and some people wake up for coffee.</p> <p>With the former, coffee acts as a stable morning ritual: a caffeinated breakfast complement, or the\r\n   patient carpool companion on the morning commute. With the latter, coffee is an\r\n   all-encompassing religion: the ground of bean by which all existence and meaning\r\n   flow.\r\n</p> <p>These coffee-devotees are known as \"dripsters,\" and they hold bean quality and brewing methodology to the\r\n   highest possible standard. They refuse to compromise their values, and thus, the Personalized Mug Mini\r\n   Crate is the dripster's dream come true.\r\n</p> <h4>Small Batch, Big World</h4> <p>No dripster has fully received coffee communion until they've drank from their very own personalized mug.\r\n   This 15 oz. stainless steel mug proudly proclaims caffeine devotion to the world and\r\n   can be laser-etched with the given family name or a newly christened dripster name.\r\n</p> <p>Forever gone are the dark days of pouring commoner's caffeine from the office coffee pot. With the portable\r\n   GSI Java Drip and Alpha coffee grinds, the dripster can now indulge in the perky perks of small-batch, pour\r\n   over coffee anywhere.\r\n</p> <p>The greater telos of coffee has been achieved in the Personalized Mug Mini Crate.</p>",

It is NOT A TOY. Compact but lethal, its 12.9\" stainless steel blade is\n   equally suited for slashing through underbrush, debris-filled alleys, or hordes of the undead. If you have\n   to pick one close-combat weapon, this is it.\n</p> <h4>Keep Moving</h4> <p>Subways. Abandoned malls. Convenience stores. You learn real fast which places to avoid and which are\n   worth picking through. Either way, you never go looking for supplies without a\n  <span class=\"highlight\">reliable flashlight</span>, and you never travel without a small first aid kit and a\n   roll of duct tape for fast field repairs for yourself and your gear.\n</p> <h4>Get Educated</h4> <p>Know thyself and know thy enemy. That's what Sun Tzu said, and if it worked for a legendary warrior like\n   him, it'll work for me. Sometimes, I like to find a safe spot and keep my wits sharp by thumbing through\n   Max Brooks' definitive Zombie Survival Guide.

      "LongDescription": "<h4>The Most Dangerous Game Of All</h4> <p>If the Schwarzenegger hunting documentary \"Predator\" taught us anything, it's\r\n   that the fate of every hunter is determined by his preparedness for the unpredictable;\r\n   those rare occasions when the hunter becomes the hunted.\r\n</p> <p>It won't always be a blood-thirsty alien; it could be the vengeful brother of the cabin-mounted\r\n   trophy moose, or possibly a trigger-happy former Vice President. Whatever the predator\r\n   and whatever the prey, the Hunting Crate ensures you'll be the most dangerous creature\r\n   of all.\r\n</p> <h4>Keep Comfort In The Crosshairs</h4> <p>The Stanley extra large insulated bottle is the same classic style, stainless steel flask our grandpas\r\n   handed down to us, except without the bullet nicks from storming Normandy. Its vacuum insulation\r\n   keeps hot things hot and cold things cold for 28 hours, perfect for keeping coffee\r\n   piping hot from one morning to the next or for use as decoy bait for heat-seeking\r\n   predators.\r\n</p> <p>The Tac-Force TF-469 Folding Knife has everything needed for unzipping and grilling the freshest steak\r\n   dinner imaginable: a stainless gut hook blade, silicone grip ring, hard nylon sheath, fire starter, diamond\r\n   honing file, and bottle opener. And if Mother Nature is being a real downer, the capsule of stormproof\r\n   matches will light in even the worst of circumstances.\r\n</p> <h4>Unseen and Unscented</h4> <p>For starters, the camo form wrap and facepaint disguises anyone and anything as slightly\r\n   off-grey splotches by which animals see the world. But invisible isn't enough to\r\n   be utterly undetectable to the heightened senses of predator and prey.\r\n</p> <p>Duke Cannon's Big Ol' Brick of Hunting Soap will wash any whiff of human clean off your\r\n   body. It's like those Axe body spray commercials when, once applied, beautiful women\r\n   ambush the man out of sheer desire, except instead of ambushing him, they'll completely\r\n   ignore him. And instead of beautiful women, it's a moose.\r\n</p> <p>It's a hunt or be hunted world, and the Hunting Crate equips you to always be atop the food chain.</p>",
