You gotta have the right tools for the job.\r\n Like a Grill-ionaire Fortunately, you don't need to shell out a mountain of cash to get the equipment you need to get you to\r\n   grilling nirvana. We've included some of the best accessories that every man needs to get that Grillionaire\r\n   status.\r\n Our Grill Master Man Crate includes a cast-iron smoker\r\n  box and some hickory wood chips to get you started. Set the smoker box on\r\n   the grill as it warms up, soak the hickory in some water, and drop 'em into the\r\n   box as your meat grills. Take note, men: real flavor shouldn't come from a bottled\r\n   labeled \"liquid smoke.\"\r\n We threw in a set of four  steak thermometers, too. You may say, \"hey, Team\r\n   Man Crates, isn't that cheating?\" And we say, \"nay.\" There's no dishonor in knowing how done your steak\r\n   is. And when you cut into a perfectly-cooked slab of beef, you too shall understand that G.I. Joe wasn't\r\n   kidding when he said that Knowing Is Half the Battle.\r\n And because \"the right tool for every job\" means that sometimes you'll require some brute force, we've\r\n   included a brass-knuckle meat tenderizer. Nothing blows off the steam from a\r\n   long, hard day at work like beating your meat into submission.\r\n Bone Doctors We search tirelessly, every day, to find the best-in-class goods to put in our crates. Hundreds of sauces\r\n   came and went, the grills burned for weeks, until finally a victor emerged. An unexpected dark\r\n   horse, a little-known operation out of Virginia became the Cinderella story of the\r\n   Man Crates grilling taste-off. We proudly present Bone Doctors'\r\n  BBQ sauces, pair of masterpiece sauces and a brilliant spice blend.\r\n So fire up the grill, and call your agent: after all, you're about to go pro.",

      "LongDescription": "<h4>The Right Tools for the Job</h4> <p>There's a line that separates the amateurs from the professionals. It's certainly\r\n   in the training and the experience, but folks often forget about the importance\r\n   of your equipment. Just like you can't win a NASCAR Cup in your grocery-getter,\r\n   can't crush a golf ball into orbit without a high-end driver, and aren't going\r\n   to take a trophy buck without a zeroed-in tack-driver, your grilling game will never\r\n   go next level without the right gear. You gotta have the right tools for the job.\r\n</p> <h4>Like a Grill-ionaire</h4> <p>Fortunately, you don't need to shell out a mountain of cash to get the equipment you need to get you to\r\n   grilling nirvana. We've included some of the best accessories that every man needs to get that Grillionaire\r\n   status.\r\n</p> <p>Our Grill Master Man Crate includes a cast-iron smoker\r\n  box and some hickory wood chips to get you started. Set the smoker box on\r\n   the grill as it warms up, soak the hickory in some water, and drop 'em into the\r\n   box as your meat grills. Take note, men: real flavor shouldn't come from a bottled\r\n   labeled \"liquid smoke.\"\r\n</p> <p>We threw in a set of four  steak thermometers, too. You may say, \"hey, Team\r\n   Man Crates, isn't that cheating?\" And we say, \"nay.\" There's no dishonor in knowing how done your steak\r\n   is. And when you cut into a perfectly-cooked slab of beef, you too shall understand that G.I. Joe wasn't\r\n   kidding when he said that Knowing Is Half the Battle.\r\n</p> <p>And because \"the right tool for every job\" means that sometimes you'll require some brute force, we've\r\n   included a brass-knuckle meat tenderizer. Nothing blows off the steam from a\r\n   long, hard day at work like beating your meat into submission.\r\n</p> <h4>Bone Doctors</h4> <p>We search tirelessly, every day, to find the best-in-class goods to put in our crates. Hundreds of sauces\r\n   came and went, the grills burned for weeks, until finally a victor emerged. An unexpected dark\r\n   horse, a little-known operation out of Virginia became the Cinderella story of the\r\n   Man Crates grilling taste-off. We proudly present Bone Doctors'\r\n  BBQ sauces, pair of masterpiece sauces and a brilliant spice blend.\r\n</p> <p>So fire up the grill, and call your agent: after all, you're about to go pro.</p>",

With shaping lessons, not-too-long\n   history blurbs, and over 65 recipes from shells to sauces, Pasta By Hand incorporates\n   authentic Italian techniques and fancy Italian words for delicious, crafted cuisine.\n</p> <p>Mezzetta's Truffle, Porcini &amp; Cream Marina beckons forth the seasoning of Southern Italy,\n   and Passione's Semolina Flour is the godfather of authentic Italian flavor, ideal\n   for formation and flavor.\n</p> <h4>Free the Gluten!</h4> <p>We're sick of gluten being treated like a second-class storage protein. The custom-designed\n   cooking apron is the banner of the Flour Revolution, demanding all starches be freed\n   from their shackles and suspicions.\n</p> <p>Said revolution is armed with kitchen artillery for forming pasta pieces with flavor\n   and flair; a potato ricer, chop-scrape blade, and gnocchi board to groove pieces\n   for storing sauce.\n</p> <p>In a world where mass batches of pasta are hung out to dry by machines, the Pasta Craft\n   Crate takes a stand for authentic, artisanal pasta in every home.\n</p>",

We developed the Dutch Oven Project\n   Kit to transform the average/below-average camping cook into a culinary master.\n</p> <h5>Much Lovin' Dutch Oven</h5> <p>The cast-iron Dutch Oven belongs to a storied tradition of five-star frontier flavor. Fun fact: Lewis and\n   Clark cooked with multiple Dutch Ovens during their western expedition. Less fun fact: they were probably\n   cooking Raccoon Ragout and Possum Porridge.\n</p> <p>The Dutch Oven we've selected is a pre-seasoned 12\" cast-iron pot that can stew, braise, roast, bake, boil,\n   fry, or poach 6-7 quarts of gourmet buffet. We've also included Campmaid's kickstand/lid-lifter ideal for\n   raising the roof when the pot gets hot, or propping up the oven to bait and trap curious forest critters.\n</p> <h4>Rust-Free Recipes</h4> <p>Like a veteran quarterback, a cast-iron pot requires tender care and attention to maintain any semblance of\n   a season. This kit includes a chain mail scrubber and cast iron conditioner to keep the oven tasty and\n   rust-free.\n</p> <p>The DIY Dutch Oven Guide includes Dutch Oven care methods, cooking techniques, and most importantly, five\n   amazing and simple Man Crates recipes for ultimate outdoor flavor. We'd risk scoliosis backpacking\n   a Dutch Oven to every campsite and cookout if it meant getting to enjoy meals like\n   the Tri-Animal Jambalaya or Classic Cobbler.\n</p> <p>For the guy who tends to make his feasts in the forest, the Dutch Oven is everything but the kitchen sink\n   to make the outdoors a tastier place.\n</p>",

A meager breakfast has been prepped, and he’s managed to get dressed for his board meeting in clothes that may or may not be inside out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day is a battle, and those last-minute, sugary cereals aren’t going to help him survive those boardroom bombshells. Make sure he nourishes himself properly with these artisan biscuits and grits. And if he needs that extra kick, spice things up with Brooklyn-based Mike’s Hot Honey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes more than a pocket protector to dodge that spreadsheet shrapnel. Help him stay energized all day with the Man Crates Breakfast Rations Ammo Can. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Food Facts</h4>\r\n<li>Callie’s Buttermilk Biscuit Mix is made by hand in the American South. Because if you want something done right...</li>\r\n<li>Callie’s Grits are stone ground on machines older than the workers using them.</li>\r\n<li>When not yelling at taxi drivers, New York bees are busy making Mike’s Hot Honey. A sweet and spicy, chili pepper-infused wildflower honey made in New York apiaries.</li>\r\n<li>These rations come shipped in an air-tight, waterproof, and explosion-proof ammo can. We take breakfast seriously.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>",
