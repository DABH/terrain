## Directory Overview

### Web
Directory containing files to host on a webserver. Currently, these are static files that can be served by any simple server, e.g. Apache or `$ sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`

* `/web` -- should just be `index.html` in here
* `/web/partials` -- contains HTML partial files, used by Angular
* `/web/assets` -- everything else
* `/web/assets/ajax` -- endpoints for data retrieval
* `/web/assets/color-admin` -- the theme we're using
* `/web/assets/[css|img|js]` -- self explanatory
