How to use Notifications:
In App.tsx:
import {InAppNotification} from './common/components/InAppNotification'
render()
  ...
  <InAppNotification />
  ...

Anywhere you want to trigger notifications from:
import {notificationManager} from 'path/InAppNotification'

addNotification()
  notificationManager.addNotification("message", type ("info" or "error"), timeOut (optional, 0=no timeout));

render()
  ...
  <div onClick={this.addNotification} >Trigger notification!</div>
  ...
