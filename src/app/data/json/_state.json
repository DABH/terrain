As you already know, I am a part-time/occasional babysitter, as well as I am a birth Doula (DONA), and I volunteer with multiple organizations including the RedCross. I am also a Brand Ambassador for the UrbanSitter and I work closely with plenty other sitters and parents, too. \n\nI have been in childcare for about 7 years. I started off doing occasional date nights, at the age of 13, for family members and family friends. At 15, I worked as a volunteer teacher's assistant at a summer camp for children with learning disabilities. Once I began my college career in 2011, I became a teacher's assistant at a Montessori Pre-School and I was working as a Student Event Coordinator, as well. I later joined UrbanSitter in order to find part-time work.\n\nI believe that children are amazing little beings with the best personalities. They are all so different, which makes my job even better. There is never a dull moment at work because of all the different families I am able to work with. I enjoy what I do and I do my best to give families the help they really need. I always look forward to meeting new families, and hope to hear from you. Please feel free to book me if you feel I am the sitter for your child.\n"

I have two younger sisters (currently aged 18 and 19) and have been babysitting them since I was 12 years old. I was always a helpful hand while my sisters were younger so I learned a lot about child care from my parents and my own nannies while I was growing up. I began as a mother's helper when I was about 10 with a family in my neighborhood with a boy and a girl between ages 2-4. I progressed with that family to full time babysitting and learned a lot through my experiences babysitting with them. Because I had two younger sisters, I spent a lot of time babysitting them when my parents went out and gained a lot of experience babysitting for their friends' families as well. \n\nThrough middle school and high school I babysat on the weekends and mainly looked after toddlers to school aged children. After I graduated High School, I was a nanny for a 3 year old and a 15 month old for part of the summer. After that, I was a nanny for 3 years for two pre-teen/teenagers while I attended Foothill Community College; I was also a nanny for a 1st grader for a year and half and occasionally watched after his little 3 year old sister when she was not in daycare. \n\nI love kids and am interested in teaching Kindergarten or First grade before I attend Law School or find my dream job. When babysitting or nannying, I usually bring the kids to the park and play with them there, take them on trips to museums or other fun outings, and do things at home like reading, arts and crafts, playing with toys and dolls, and building things like forts. For older children I have no problem driving them around to activities and picking them up from school and helping with homework.\n"

Couple more quarters left and I'll be ready to transfer to a local four year. \n\nI became a nanny because I love kids and it worked around my school schedule, school is definitely a priority. Currently I am working for a regular family. In the afternoons, I work with two sweet girls, ages 6 and 10. On a weekly basis, we usually go to the library, go to the park, we bake, go swimming, do art and other fun activities. I ,myself, love to travel, I am very outdoorsy so I love taking the girls out instead of being home all day.\n\nI am looking for more hours doing some occasional sitting. My calendar is usually up to date, but feel free to message me regarding the hours. Also if I'm not available, my mom (Ermelinda F https://[removed][removed]/profile/ermelinda-flores ) is on the site too, she raised me so obviously she's good :)\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.\n"

My experience with children is in babysitting for neighbors and family friends outside of the home and nannying two boys for the past year, I learned a great deal from caring for my sister growing up. I am an academic at heart, so I love to help with homework. My high school had an excellent culinary program and I had the opportunity to be trained in an industrial kitchen, so I'm happy to help with meal prep. I am a very cautious driver and a rather cautious person in general. I am a fan of both creativity and structure. I enjoy crafting, photography, cooking and baking.
