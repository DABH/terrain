      A WHERE clause in SQL specifies that a SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statement should only affect 
      rows that meet specified criteria. The criteria are expressed in the form of predicates. WHERE clauses are 
      not mandatory clauses of SQL DML statements, but can be used to limit the number of rows affected by a SQL 
      DML statement or returned by a query. In brief SQL WHERE clause is used to extract only those results from 
      a SQL statement, such as: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement."
