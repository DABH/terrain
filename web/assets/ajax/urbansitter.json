As you already know, I am a part-time/occasional babysitter, as well as I am a birth Doula (DONA), and a Red Cross & Girls on the Run Volunteer. I occasionally work as a Brand Ambassador for the UrbanSitter site and I work closely with plenty other sitters and parents, too. I have been in childcare for about 7 years. I started off doing occasional date nights, at the age of 13, for family members and family friends. At 15, I worked as a volunteer teacher's assistant at a summer camp for children with learning disabilities. Once I began my college career in 2011, I became a teacher's assistant at a Montessori Pre-School and I was working as a Student Event Coordinator, as well. I later joined UrbanSitter in order to find part-time work. I believe that children are amazing little beings with the best personalities. They are all so different, which makes my job even better. There is never a dull moment at work because of all the different families I am able to work with. I enjoy what I do and I do my best to give families the help they really need. I always look forward to meeting new families, and hope to hear from you. Please feel free to book me if you feel I am the sitter for your child."},
